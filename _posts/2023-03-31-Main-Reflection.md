During this semester, I gained valuable experience in web application development by creating a Rust-based web application using the Yew framework. This project enabled me to learn and apply various new skills including:

- **Rust programming language**: I learned Rust's fundamentals, such as its syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Web development concepts**: I gained knowledge of web development concepts, such as HTTP protocol, and frontend and backend development.
- **Yew framework**: I learned how to use Yew, a Rust-based framework for building frontend web applications.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: I gained knowledge of these languages to create the frontend of the web application.
- **Git**: I gained experience in using Git to manage code changes and collaborate with other team members.

By the end of this mini-project, I acquired and learned a number of new skills, such as

- **WebAssembly**: I learned about WebAssembly and how it enables running code written in other languages, such as Rust, on the web.
- **Routing**: I learned how to implement routing in Yew to navigate between different pages of the web application.
- **Yew components**: I learned how to create Yew components, which are reusable pieces of code, to implement common UI elements, such as buttons and forms.

**Challenge**
- One of the biggest challenges I faced during the mini-project was setting up the development environment for Rust and Yew. It took me some time to understand the project structure and how to use the Trunk server tool, which is used to build and serve Yew applications. 
- Implementing and routing the pages with Yew

By the end, the mini project was a good opportunity to practice my learning in Rust laguage skills into an application to desgin something and  I found that using Rust and Yew, we can create powerful and robust web applications with the right resources.
