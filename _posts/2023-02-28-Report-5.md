# Loops in Rust

Similar to other programming languages Rust had while and for loops adding to that, Rust also had the **loop** pre defined function which starts the loops immeditely.

# Rust loop
A **loop** expression that prints “Hello” until it is broken by a condition:


        let mut count = 0;
        loop {
            count += 1;
            println!("Hello");
            if count == 5 {
                break;
            }
        }

# While loop
A while expression that prints numbers from 1 to 5, it is created with the keyword **while**.

      let mut counter = 1;
      while counter < 6 {
          println!("{}", counter);
          counter += 1;
      }
# For Loop
A **for** expression that iterates over a range and prints 
“FizzBuzz” for multiples of 15
“Fizz” for multiples of 3 and “Buzz” for multiples of 5:

        for n in 1..101 {
                    if n % 15 == 0 {
                        println!("FizzBuzz");
                    } else if n % 3 == 0 {
                        println!("Fizz");
                    } else if n % 5 == 0 {
                        println!("Buzz");
                    } else {
                        println!("{}", n);
                    }
                }
