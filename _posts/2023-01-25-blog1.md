# Why Rust?
I have seen many language names in the internet and also demand in linkedIn and other job platforms to findout which langauge is best to invest my time for this semster, and I found out 'RUST', Cause over the last six years since from 2016 to 2022 Rust is one of the most loved lanugages by developers according to stackoverflow suvery's each year.

1. Rust usage is gradually increasing upon each year
2. It is a systems programming language it mainly focus on saftey, speed and reliability  
3. It is fast and more safe version of language C++ upgrade.
