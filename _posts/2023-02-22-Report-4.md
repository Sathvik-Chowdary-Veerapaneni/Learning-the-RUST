In this blog, you will learn about some important topics in programming, such as function parameters which is very widely used in every programming, Control structures and loop statements in Rust, Control structures let us execute different code blocks based on conditions. Loop statements let us repeat a task multiple times. This way, we can avoid redundant or unnecessary code and handle different scenarios with ease. We can also save time and space in our code and make it easier to debug and maintain.


# If Else

In Rust, ifâ€¦else statement allows us add alternative set of test conditions in ifâ€¦else statement using else-if and single else statements for if condition1. 

For example ðŸ¦–:

            let x = 3;

            if x < 10 {
                println!("{} is less than 10", x);
            } else {
                println!("{} is greater than or equal to 10", x);
            }
    
    
    Output:-
        
            This code prints 3 is less than 10 because the condition x < 10 is true.
