Similar to other programming languages, **RUST** had some predefined words such that these keywords cannot be used as a variable names or creating functions.

We already know that, by default Rust creates immutable variables, but we can change that by adding **â€˜mutâ€™** in-front of variable name.

**Creating a default variable x**

    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
        x = 6;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    }

**Error ðŸ›‘**

    let x = 5;  - first assignment to `x`
    x = 6;      - Cannot assign twice to immutable variable



**Creating a muttable variable x**

     fn main() {
          let mut x = 5;
          println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
          x = 6;
          println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
      }


**Output ðŸ¦–**

    The value of x is: 5
    The value of x is: 6

# What is main difference between a immutable Variable and a Constant?

A constant is like a value that never changes. It is declared, when the program is created, and it can't be changed during the program's execution. 

**for example** ,  pi which is 3.14, you will fix this value while creating the program, and it cannot be changed until the completion of program. 
An immutable variable, on the other hand, is like a value that can be set once and then never changed again. 

Suppose you want to calculate the area of a rectangle (length * breadth) and the volume of a box (length * breadth * height), where the length is the same for both calculations, and you need to get the length from the user input and the length cannot be changed up to at the end of the program.
